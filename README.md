# Programming-Methodology-for-Numerical-Computing-and-Finance
This is a design oriented course that meets in a computer lab/classroom for maximum emphasis on hands-on programming. Lectures will be reinforced with small programming examples during the lecture, followed by homeworks and lab exercises that will focus on numerical computing and computational financial applications. 
The final project is a realization of stock/bank account management system in C++. All the history simulated transactions can be saved in txt files. OpenGL is used to plot the changes of the whole portfolio value.
